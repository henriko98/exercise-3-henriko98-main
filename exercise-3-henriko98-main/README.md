# Exercise 3 in TKT4140

This is your private repository for the exercise. You can find information about how to interact with the repository [here](https://tkt4140.github.io/TKT4140-digital-compendium/parts/CourseInfo/GitGitHubAndGitHubClassroom.html).

You will find the following files:

* **pexercise\*.pdf** - The problem set
* **p\*.ipynb** - Jupyter Notebooks where you shall add and commit your solution to the respective problem in the problem set (p1 for Problem 1 and so on)
* **p\*_help.py** - Python files where you can commit your code for help or guidance
* **README.md** - This info file
* **.gitignore** - A file that specifies intentionally untracked files for git to ignore


You can commit your solutions whenever you like and as many times as you want. When the exercise deadline has passed, your final commit will count as your answer. The TA's will only grade the notebook files.

If you get stuck, or need help, please commit your code in the relevant **p\*_help**-file so that the TA's can view your code and help you in the [guidance sessions](https://tkt4140.github.io/TKT4140-digital-compendium/parts/CourseInfo/Timetable.html#guidance-sessions).
